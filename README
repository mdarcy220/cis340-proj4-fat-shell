# CIS 340 Project 3


## Description 
update our floppy disc reader from project 3 to a full shell.  that supports
input redirection and line parsing.  Update all of the previous functions into
executable files that run as a child process from the parent shell process.
include two new commands into the shell.  A path command which shows current path
and a 'cd' command that changes the directory within the shell

## Compiling
To compile the shell, simply use the makefile at the command prompt in the directory
where the files are located by typing 'make' at the command prompt.

## Sample output

path import, path commands
path import appends the currents the current path to the path command
path shows the current path

flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4/src$ path import
flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4/src$ path
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4/src$ 

cd -  changes current directory

flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4/src$ cd ..
flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4$ cd src
flop:/home/student/midarcy/shared/proj4/src$ 

we included the current directory path into the flop prompt.
